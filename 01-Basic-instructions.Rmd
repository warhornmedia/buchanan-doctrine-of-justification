# Basic instructions

## Creating a new book

1. Go to [the repo](https://github.com/warhornmedia/warhorn-classics-book-template) on Github and click "Use this template." 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/screenshot1.png')
```

2. Change the owner to warhornmedia. Enter a repository name using the format "authorlastname-short-book-title". Set the repository to public. And include all branches. Then click "Create repository from template"

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/screenshot2.png')
```

3. Clone the new repo to your computer and navigate into its folder in Terminal. Then run the following command locally, answering 'yes' to both questions.[^1] 

    ```
    travis encrypt GITHUB_PAT=yourTokenGoesHere --com --add -x
    ```

[^1]: [Here are instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for creating a Github Personal Access Token if you don't have one yet. (Check the “repo” box under "scopes" to give the necessary permissions.)

    Also, if you don't have [travis](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation) installed on your computer yet, you can install it with this command: 

    ```
      brew install travis
    ```

    If you don't have [brew](https://brew.sh) installed yet... prepare yourself for some waiting. You can install it with this command:

    ```
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```

*Congrats!* You now have a new book that will rebuild automatically any time you push changes to github.
