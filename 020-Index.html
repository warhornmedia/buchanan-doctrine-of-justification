<li id="fn2"><p>These various opinions are represented respectively by the following writers:—The first by Dr. Taylor of Norwich, in his ‘Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin,’ and his ‘Key to the Apostolic Writings,’ which are answered by President Edwards in his ‘Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin,’ Works, vol. ii. pt. ii. sec. ii. The second by Henry Dodwell, in his ‘Epistolary Discourse, proving that the Soul is naturally Mortal, but immortalized by its union with the Divine Baptismal Spirit, imparted only by the Bishops;’ which was answered by Dr. S. Clarke in his ‘Letter to Mr. Dodwell.’ It has been recently revived, in a different form, by Mr. Edward White, in his work entitled, ‘Life in Christ’ (1846)—which is directed to prove that ‘Immortality is the peculiar privilege of the regenerate.’ The third by many modern writers, who make spiritual death to consist entirely in sin, as a subjective moral evil, and overlook the wrath and curse of God on account of past transgressions. On this subject, see the profound treatise of Dr. Thomas Goodwin, ‘An Unregenerate Man’s Guiltiness before God in respect of Sin and Punishment,’ Works, vol. x. pp. 1–56, Nichol’s Edition.<a href="002-History-of-the-Doctrine-in-the-Old-Testament.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>Rom. 4:4: ‘μισθος κατὰ χάριν,—μισθὸς κατὰ τὸ ὀφείλημα.’ ‘Meritum ex condigno’ is distinguished, even by Popish writers, from ‘Meritum ex pacto’ or ‘ex promissione;’ but in treating of the latter, in connection with the rewards which are promised to believers under the New Covenant, they overlook the fact that these are promised on account of the merits of Christ. There is still a wide difference between ‘rewards of debt,’ and ‘rewards of grace;’ for while both were promised,—the one under the first, the other under the second, covenant,—yet the former were to be bestowed on the ground of personal obedience, while the latter are bestowed on account of the obedience of Him with whom the covenant was made on behalf of His people; that is, on the ground of His vicarious and imputed righteousness. ‘The whole tenor of Revelation shows, that there are but two methods whereby any of the human race can be justified: either by a perfect obedience to the law in their own persons, and then “the reward is of debt,” i.e. pactional debt, founded on the obligation of the covenant, not springing from any worth in the obedience. Or else, because the Surety of a better covenant has satisfied all demands in their stead; and then “the reward is of grace,” Rom. 4:4.’—Hervey’s Works, vol. ii. p. 296.<a href="002-History-of-the-Doctrine-in-the-Old-Testament.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>On the first covenant of life, see Witsius, ‘De Œconomia Fœderum Dei,’ lib. i. c. ii.–viii. pp. 8–99; Burmann, ‘Synopsis,’ vol. i. lib. ii. c. ii. pp. 389–475; Bishop Hopkins on ‘The Two Covenants;’ Boston on ‘The Covenant of Works;’ Dr. Russel (of Dundee) on ‘The Adamic and Mediatorial Dispensations’; Dr. Meikle (of Beith) on ‘The Edenic Dispensation;’ Mr. Strong on ‘The Covenants;’ Mr. Barrett on ‘The Covenants,’ pp. 38–75; and many more. As some have denied the literal truth of the Mosaic narrative on this subject, see also Holden’s ‘Dissertation on the Fall of Man, in which the literal sense of the Mosaic Account of that event is Asserted and Vindicated,’ 1823; also Jo. Witty, ‘Vindication of the History of the Fall of Adam,’ 1705.</p>
<p>‘I begin with the first revelation which God made of Himself, and of His will, to man in the beginning of time; and from thence ’I would descend to later revelations, both before, and in, Gospel times. The holy, all-wise God, having created reasonable creatures, gave to them a Law, the rule of that obedience and duty which is the natural result of the relation between God the Creator, and such creatures. This Law required perfect sinless obedience. No less could God call for; no less was suited to the state of innocence and perfection, wherein man was created. This Law, given at first, was written on the heart, and needed not to be externally proposed. That positive prohibition, Not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was but for the trial of obedience; and the tree itself, a sacrament or symbol of death, in case of disobedience, as the tree of life was a symbol or sacrament of life, in case of obedience. These symbols clearly show that the Law was established into a covenant. And a covenant it was, truly and properly; for Adam had no right to deny his consent to the terms which God proposed; and, being yet sinless and holy, he had no will thereto, but agreed both to the preceptive part, and to the sanction, as “holy, just, and good.” ’—Beart, Vindication of the Eternal Law and Everlasting Gospel, p. 2. London, 1753. This work is recommended by Hervey (‘Theron and Aspasio,’ vol. ii. p. 20) as a ‘most excellent treatise,’ which has ‘the very sinews of the argument, and, the very marrow of the doctrine.’ It consists of two parts, and has been frequently reprinted.<a href="002-History-of-the-Doctrine-in-the-Old-Testament.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>The first promise, or primeval Gospel. ‘De Evangelio; Quid sit. Evangelium est doctrina à Deo immediatè patefacta, de gratuita reconciliatione hominum lapsorum, et remissione peccatorum per Messiam, quæ fide accipienda est, adferens atque impertiens justitiam coram Deo, Messiæ passions acquisitam, pacem conscientiæ, et vitam eternam. Hæc definitio ex suavissimis dictis Scripturæ sacræ—Gen. 3:22, et aliis sumpta est.’—Wigandus and Judex, Syntagma, p. 944.</p>
<p>The effect of this revelation of God’s purpose of mercy in changing the whole state and experience of our first parents, is stated, with a grand simplicity, by John Knox, when, speaking of the three cardinal points,—our sin and misery,—God’s promise of grace,—and the effect of faith in it,—he says, ‘All this plainly may be perceived in the life of our first parent Adam, who, by transgression of God’s commandment, fell in great trouble and affliction,—from which he should never have been released, without the goodness of God had first called him. And, secondly, made unto him the promise of his salvation, the which Adam believing, before ever he wrought good works, was reputed just. After, during all his life, he continued in good works, striving contrary to Satan, the world, and his own flesh.’—Knox’s Works, vol. iii. p. 439,—the admirable edition, for which the Church is indebted to David Laing, Esq., of the Library of the Writers to the Signet, Edinburgh.</p>
<p>‘Had Adam felt,’ says Zuingle, ‘that he had anything remaining after his fall which might gain the favour of his Maker, he would not have fled “to hide himself;” but his case appeared to himself so desperate, that we do not read even of his having recourse to supplication. He dared not at all to appear before God. But here the mercy and kindness of the Most High are displayed, who recalls the fugitive, even when, with a traitor’s mind, he is passing over to the camp of the enemy, and not even offering a prayer for pardon; receives him to His mercy; and, as far as His justice would permit, restores him to a happy state. Here the Almighty exhibited a splendid example of what He would do for the whole race of Adam, sparing them, and treating them with kindness, even when they deserved only punishment. Here, then, Religion took its rise, when God recalled despairing, fugitive man to Himself.’—Zuingle, De Vera et Falsâ Religione, p. 169.</p>
<p>‘All the promises,’ says Luther, ‘are to be referred to that first promise concerning Christ, “The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent’s head,” Gen. 3:15. So did all the prophets both understand it, and teach it. By this we may see that the faith of our fathers in the Old Testament, and ours now in the New, is all one, although they differ as touching their outward object. Which thing Peter witnesseth in the Acts (15:11): “We believe that, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.” … The faith of the fathers was grounded on Christ which was to come, as ours is on Christ which is now come. Abraham in his time was justified by faith in Christ to come; but if he lived at this day, he would be justified by faith in Christ now revealed and present. Like as I have said before of Cornelius, who at the first believed in Christ to come, but, being instructed by Peter, he believed that Christ was already come. Therefore the diversity of times never changeth faith, nor the Holy Ghost, nor the gifts thereof. For there hath been, is, and ever shall be, one mind, one judgment and understanding, concerning Christ, as well in the ancient fathers, as in the faithful which are at this day, and shall come hereafter. So we also have a Christ to come; and to believe in Him, as the fathers in the Old Testament had. For we look for Him to come again in the last day with glory, to judge both the quick and the dead, whom now we believe to be come already for our salvation.’—On the Galatians, pp. 187, 188. ‘All the faithful have had alway one and the self-same Gospel from the beginning of the world, and by that they were saved.’ … ’Christ came in spirit to the fathers of the Old Testament, before He came in the flesh. They had Christ in spirit. They believed in Christ which should be revealed, as we believe in Christ which is now revealed, and were saved by Him as we are, according to that saying, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.” “Yesterday,” before the time of His coming in the flesh; “to-day,” when He was revealed “in the time before appointed.” Now and “for ever” He is one and the same Christ: for even by Him only, and alone, all the faithful which either have been, be, or shall be, are delivered from the law, justified, and saved,—Ibid. pp. 258, 295.<a href="002-History-of-the-Doctrine-in-the-Old-Testament.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>In the question respecting the Justification of Old Testament believers, the principal points are these,—the fact that they were justified,—the reason or ground of their pardon and acceptance,—and the means by which they were made partakers of this privilege.</p>
<p>The fact that they were justified, in the full Gospel sense of that expression, can scarcely be questioned; since they are expressly declared to have been freely forgiven, and restored to the favour and friendship of God. The fact was even divinely attested: Abel ‘obtained witness that he was righteous;’ Enoch, ‘before his translation, had this testimony, that he pleased God’ (Heb. 11:4, 5). They not only possessed, but they enjoyed, this Gospel privilege; for ‘David describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin’ (Rom. 4:6, 7; Ps. 32). ‘I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin’ (Ps. 32:5). ‘Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits; who forgiveth all thins iniquities’ (Ps. 103:2, 3). The fact, then, is undeniable that they were justified, in the full sense of that expression,—that they were freely forgiven, and graciously accepted as righteous, so as to be restored to the favour, friendship, and fellowship of God.</p>
<p>The reason or ground of their Justification was not their own personal righteousness,—for they were ‘guilty,’ ‘ungodly,’ unclean,’ unable to ‘stand in judgment,’—but the work of Christ, the promised Seed. For that work, although postponed till ‘the fulness of times,’ had a retrospective efficacy; it was accomplished for ‘the redemption of the transgressions which were under the first testament’ (Heb. 9:15), and Old Testament believers could say, ‘He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was laid upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed’ (Isa. 53:5). ‘The covenant (of grace) was differently administered in the time of the Law, and the time of the Gospel: under the Law it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come, which were, for that time, sufficient, and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation.’—‘Although the work of redemption was not actually wrought by Christ till after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits thereof, were communicated unto the elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein He was revealed and signified to be “the Seed of the woman which should bruise the serpent’s head,”—and “the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,” being “yesterday and to-day the same, and for ever.” ’—Westminster Confession of Faith, c. vii. s. 5, viii. s. 6. See Bishop Barlow, ‘Remains,’ pp. 584–593; Bishop O’Brien, ‘Nature and Effects of Faith,’ p. 439; H. Witsius, ‘Animadversiones Irenicæ,’ Mis. Sac. ii. p. 780; Bishop Downham ‘on Justification,’ p. 180.</p>
<p>The means of their Justification was faith. This follows necessarily from its being left to depend on the work of Christ, for that work was still future; it was a matter of promise, and a promise can only be embraced by faith. But it is expressly declared to have been by faith; for it is written, ‘The just shall live by faith’ (Gal. 3:11), and ‘Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness’ (Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6). Whether faith was itself their righteousness, and in what sense it was imputed to them, will be considered in the sequel.<a href="002-History-of-the-Doctrine-in-the-Old-Testament.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>The question whether Sacrifice was a divine institution, or a human invention, has given rise to much discussion. On the one side, see Davison, ‘Inquiry into the Origin and Intent of Primitive Sacrifice,’ also a note in his ‘Discourses on Prophecy;’ ‘Correspondence between Bishop Jebb and Mr. Knox,’ vol. i. pp. 455–462; Dr. Sykes, ‘Essay on Sacrifice.’ On the other, Archbishop M’Gee ‘On the Atonement;’ Shuckford’s ‘Connection of Sacred and Profane History,’ vol. i. p. 177, i. 370–385, i. 439–495, iv. pp. 48–60,—American Edition in 4 vols.; James Richie, M.D., ‘Criticism on Modern Notions of Sacrifice,’ particularly recommended by Dr. M’Gee on the ‘Origin of Sacrifice,’ also his ‘Peculiar Doctrines of Revelation,’ p. 137; Dr. John Edwards, ‘Survey of Divine Dispensations,’ vol. i. 91–99; Dr. R. Gordon, ‘Christ as made known to the Ancient Church,’ vol. i. pp. 46–66; Dr. Outram on ‘Sacrifices,’ passim.</p>
<p>The moral meaning, and typical reference, of sacrifice, are well stated by Mr. Beart. ‘The sacrifices of old were offered in the room of the offender, whose “laying his hand thereon” (Lev. 1:4, 3:2) signified the transferring of his sin and guilt unto his victim. As if he should say, “I freely own I have deserved to die for such and such sins; but, Lord, by Thine appointment, I bring here a sacrifice, a poor animal, to die for me: accept it in my stead.” It is true, these sacrifices could not do away sins (Heb. 10:1), but were referred, in their whole typical nature and use, to Christ’s sacrifice, through which there is a real and eternal forgiveness, whereof that ceremonial forgiveness, which was by these sacrifices, was only a type.’—Beart’s Vindication, p. 55. See Hervey’s Works, ii. pp. 60, 88, 97–100, 264; P. Allinga, ‘The Satisfaction of Christ,’ translated by Rev. T.

<li id="fn9"><p>‘The Divine Person who was so often seen by Abraham, when God was said to appear unto him, was our blessed Saviour, then in being ages before He “took upon Him the seed of Abraham.” Abraham, therefore, literally speaking, saw Him; and our Saviour might very justly conclude from Abraham’s thus seeing Him, that He was really in being before Abraham. Abraham built his altars, not unto God, whom “no man hath seen at any time,” but unto “the Lord who appeared unto him;” and in all the accounts we have of his prayers, we find that they were offered up in the name of this Lord.’—Dr. S.

<!--- make it so en dashes never break, ORIGINAL script using .nobreak CSS span::: problem: breaks popup functionality of refTagger, even though the RegEx avoids messing with any refTagger refs; problem is with the script targeting any element which includes the refTagger, even if the RegEx avoids doing anything to the refTagger link HTML itself. It does not seem possible to use selectors to select everything but avoid selecting <a> tags with class "rtBibleRef". Problem is that if you select the <p> which has the link in it, you can't avoid selecting the <a> inside it. Script doesn't break reftagger if it is loaded on document.ready. Solution seems to be to find a way to use document.ready and somehow avoid Scripture ref en dashes. Maybe borrow reftagger's bible book regex, but that seems hopeless, esp. since I don't believe there's general browser support for negative lookbehind RegEx...
