Hence controversy Socinians turned, much main question—‘shall man just God?’—various questions, , however important , merely preliminary, conclusively disposed , precise doctrine nature, method, ground sinner’s justification entertained subject discussion . Socinian doctrine Justification might, doubtless, disproved express testimonies Scripture bearing precise point,—doctrine Reformers established opposition , without aid peculiar truths Revelation depended; truths either denied, explained away, Socinians, impose antagonists arduous task defending revealed truth every point along whole line theological inquiry.
