<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It may be thought by some that the subject of Justification is trite and
exhausted; that, as one of the ‘commonplaces’ of Theology, it was
conclusively determined and settled at the era of the Reformation; and
that nothing new or interesting can now be introduced into the
discussion of it. It is not necessary to say in reply to this, as some
might be disposed to say, that ‘what is new in Theology is not true, and
what is true is not new;’ for we believe, and are warranted by the whole
history of the Church in believing, that Theology, like every other
science, is progressive,—progressive, not in the sense of adding
anything to the truth once for all revealed in the inspired Word, but in
the way of eliciting and unfolding what has always been contained in
it,—of bringing out one lesson after another, and placing each of them
in a clearer and stronger light,—and discovering the connection,
interdependency, and harmony, of all the constituent parts of the
marvellous scheme of Revelation. In this sense, Science and Theology are
both progressive, the one in the study of God’s works, the other in the
study of God’s Word; and as human Science has not yet exhausted the
volume of Nature, or reached the limit of possible discovery in regard
to it, much less has human Theology fathomed the depths of Scripture, or
left nothing to reward further inquiry into ‘the manifold wisdom of
God.’ There may be room, therefore, for something new, if not in the
substance, yet in the treatment, even of the great doctrine of
Justification,—in the exposition of its scriptural meaning, and in the
method of adducing, arranging, and applying the array of its scriptural
proofs.</p>
<p>But apart from this, and looking to the character of our current
literature, may it not be said that, to a large class of minds in the
present age, nothing could well be more <em>new</em> than the <em>old</em> Theology of
the Reformation? The Gospel is older than Luther; but, to every
succeeding generation, it is still new,—good news from God,—as fresh now
as when it first sprung from the fountain of Inspiration. It was new to
ourselves,—surprising, startling, and affecting us strangely, as if it
were almost too good to be true,—when it first shone, like a beam of
heaven’s own light, into our dark and troubled spirits, and shed abroad
‘a peace which passeth all understanding.’ It will be equally new to our
children, and our children’s children, when they come to know that they
have sins to be forgiven, and souls to be saved; and to the last sinner
who is convinced and converted on the earth, it will still be as ‘good
tidings from a far country,’—as ‘cold water to a thirsty soul.’ It can
never become old or obsolete, for this obvious reason, that while it is
‘the everlasting Gospel,’ and, as such, like its Author,
unchangeable,—‘the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever,’—yet it
comes into contact, in every succeeding age, with new minds, who are
ignorant of it, but need it, and can find no peace without it; and when
they receive it as ‘a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ came into the world to save sinners,’ they will learn from
their own experience that the old truth is still the germ of ‘a new
creation’—the spring of a new life, a new peace, a new hope, a new
spiritual existence, to which they were utter strangers before.</p>
<p>There are many, even in Protestant communities, who have long been
familiar with the sound of the Gospel, to whom this inward sense of it,
in its application to their own souls, would be nothing less than a new
spiritual revelation. The doctrine of Justification, by grace, through
faith in Christ, is the old doctrine of the Reformation, and the still
older doctrine of the Gospel; yet the vivid apprehension of its meaning,
and the cordial reception of its truth, must be a new thing in the
experience of every one, when he is first enabled to realize and to
believe it. The free pardon of all sin, and a sure title to eternal
life, conferred by the mere grace of God, and resting solely on the
redemption and righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ,—this, as the
actual and immediate privilege of every sinner, on the instant when he
begins to rely on Christ alone for salvation, as He is offered to <em>him</em>
individually in the Gospel,—may come home, with all the freshness of new
truth, even to many who bear the Christian name; and a realizing sense
of them, in the conscious experience of their own souls, will be the
best safeguard against the prevailing errors of the times, and the
danger to which so many are at this moment exposed, of being ‘tossed
about with every wind of doctrine.’</p>
<p>If we take a calm survey of the state of religious sentiment in the
present crisis,—for it is a crisis, and a very solemn one,—we can hardly
fail to observe, that the minds of many are uneasy and unsettled; that
there is a wide-spread feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction; and that
this feeling manifests itself mainly in two apparently opposite
tendencies, which have been so strikingly developed in the present age
as to constitute its most marked and characteristic features;—the one is
the tendency towards Rationalism, whose final goal is a cheerless and
dreary Scepticism; the other, the tendency towards Ritualism, which can
only find its complete realization in the Church of Rome. We see one
large class of educated men relinquishing some of the most fundamental
articles of the Christian faith, as if they had no need of them for
their salvation, and contenting themselves with such lessons as Reason
can learn by the mere light of Nature, or at least prove by rational
arguments; and we see another large class of educated men betaking
themselves to forms and ceremonies, to sacramental grace and ascetic
practices, to auricular confession and priestly absolution, as if they
could not find, in the simple Gospel of the grace of God in Christ,
enough for their soul’s need, without borrowing some additions to it
from the inventions of men, and even from the corruptions of Popery.
Each of these tendencies is a symptom of the same radical evil—the want
of true peace, and good hope through grace; for those who have listened
to Christ’s voice, and complied with His gracious call, ‘Come unto me,
and ye shall find rest unto your souls,’ have an anchor, both sure and
stedfast, which keeps them, amidst all the fluctuations of human
opinion, from drifting with the current; and neither Scepticism nor
Superstition has any charms for them. ‘They have drunk of the old wine,
and have no desire for the new; for they say, The old is better.’ Those
who yield to these opposite tendencies differ in many respects from each
other; but they agree in this: they have both abandoned the old doctrine
of Justification, as revealed in the Gospel, and revived at the
Reformation; and that cardinal doctrine is the one truth which alone can
neutralize their respective errors, just as in the times of Luther it
had power to overthrow alike the speculations of the Schools, and the
superstitions of the Church. They differ in being more or less convinced
of sin, more or less earnest in seeking salvation, more or less sincere
in professing a reverential faith in God’s Word,—for the hale-hearted
Rationalist contrasts unfavourably in these respects with many an
anxious-minded Ritualist,—but the Gospel doctrine of Justification,
expounded in all its fulness, and exhibited in connection with the great
scriptural principles which it involves or implies, is the most
effective instrument at once for rousing the conscience of the
Rationalist out of its false security, and for relieving the conscience
of the Ritualist from its slavish anxieties and fears.</p>
<p>The false security of the Rationalist arises, not from the knowledge and
belief of Christ’s Gospel, but from ignorance or disbelief in regard to
the demands and sanctions of God’s Law; and the doctrine of
Justification, as it is taught in Scripture, is fitted to break up that
false security, and to awaken every thoughtful man to a sense of his
real condition in the sight of God. For, in its negative aspect, it
teaches us, first of all, how we cannot be justified,—it excludes the
possibility of pardon and acceptance, in the case of man fallen, on the
ground of his own obedience, and insists on the necessity of a
satisfaction to divine justice, such as shall be at once an adequate
expression of God’s infinite abhorrence of sin, and an effectual means
of securing all the ends of punishment under His moral government. What
the Rationalist most needs at the outset is a work of the Law on his
conscience,—a clearer and more impressive apprehension of the
spirituality and extent of its preceptive requirements,—a deeper sense
of sin—of the fact of sin, as undeniably chargeable against himself,
and, especially, of the guilt of sin, as that which exposes him to
imminent and awful danger,—a realizing conviction of those threatened
penalties, which are expressive of God’s holy hatred of it, and His
inflexible determination to punish it,—and a close and faithful
application of the whole Law to himself individually, as a sinner in the
sight of God, standing before His awful tribunal, and awaiting His
sentence, as a righteous Judge. Without some such experience as this, he
will feel little or no interest in the question of Justification, and
will scarcely be able to understand what it means, or what principles
are involved in it. But that doctrine, when it is scripturally stated
and explained in all its fulness, is related to the Law as well as to
the Gospel; and for this reason it is admirably adapted to his case,
just because it brings out, and places clearly before his conscience,
the great fundamental principles of man’s inexcusable guilt, and God’s
inflexible justice; and also because, when it proceeds to unfold a
scheme of grace and redemption, it never loses sight of these
principles, but exhibits them, all the more impressively, as exemplified
and embodied in that scheme itself, which is a divine provision for the
vindication of God’s Law, with a view to the free exercise of His mercy
towards the guilty. Let this doctrine take effect, first of all, in its
Legal aspect,—bringing the Law to bear on his conscience, convincing him
of the guilt which he has incurred, and awakening a sense of the
punishment which he has deserved, as a sinner in the sight of a holy and
righteous God; and then, but not till then, he will be prepared to
understand and appreciate it, in its Evangelical aspect, when it
proclaims a free pardon, but a pardon founded on a divine
propitiation,—a gracious remission, but a remission by means of a divine
redemption,—a full salvation, but a salvation procured by a divine
satisfaction to God’s eternal justice.</p>
<p>The anxieties of the Ritualist, again, arise from some sense of sin,
combined with a more or less earnest desire of salvation; but
accompanied also with much remaining ignorance in regard to the fulness
and freeness of the Gospel provision for his immediate pardon and
acceptance with God, and a latent feeling that there is still something
that remains to be done or suffered by himself, in the way of satisfying
the justice, averting the wrath, and propitiating the favour, of his
righteous Judge. He has ‘a zeal for God,’ but ‘not according to
knowledge;’ and ‘he goes about to establish,’ at least in part, ‘his own
righteousness,’ instead of ‘submitting,’ at once and altogether, ‘to the
righteousness of God.’ Hence he has recourse to confession and penance,
not merely for the mortification of sin, but for relief from a sense of
unforgiven guilt; and hence, too, his zeal in almsgiving and good works,
not as expressions of gratitude for grace received, but as a means of
deprecating the wrath, and securing the favour, of God. There is much in
his state of mind which contrasts favourably with the careless
indifference of multitudes who are at ease in Zion,—who have never felt
that they have sins to be forgiven, or souls to be saved,—and who are
only lulled into deeper security, and case-hardened in impenitence and
unbelief, by their partial knowledge even of the message of mercy in the
Gospel. One must feel a deep and tender sympathy with every earnest
soul, which is really convinced of its sin and danger, and struggling to
obtain deliverance,—and many a Ritualist may be in this condition. What
he needs is a deeper and more thorough conviction of his ruined and
helpless condition as a sinner, utterly unable to expiate any of his
past sins by his own sufferings, or to secure divine acceptance by
anything that he either has done, or can yet do: and along with this, a
clearer perception of the perfect all-sufficiency of the finished work
of Christ, to secure the immediate and full justification of every
sinner, on the instant when he receives and rests on Him alone for
salvation. The doctrine of Justification, therefore, as it is stated and
explained in Scripture, is exactly suited to his case, just as it was to
that of the Jewish Ceremonialist in apostolic times, and the Romish
Ritualist at the era of the Reformation; for while, in its negative
aspect, it excludes from the ground of his acceptance all works, whether
done after faith or before it, and thus cuts up by the roots the
principle of self-righteousness in its most insidious and seductive
form, it proceeds, in its positive aspect, to bring in another
righteousness—emphatically called ‘the righteousness of God,’ and to lay
it down as ‘a sure foundation in Zion;’—a righteousness already wrought
out,—a righteousness already accepted,—a righteousness proposed to him
individually by God Himself, as the ground on which he is warranted at
once to rely for his present acceptance, and his eternal welfare. As
soon as he betakes himself to this ground, and begins to rest upon it
alone, he will find, in his blessed experience, that it is adequate to
sustain his troubled soul,—to relieve it at once from all the anxieties
of unforgiven guilt,—to set it free from ‘the spirit of bondage which is
unto fear,’—and to impart ‘joy and peace in believing;’ even that ‘peace
which passeth all understanding’—‘the very peace of God reigning in the
conscience through Jesus Christ,’ and that ‘joy of the Lord’ which will
be his ‘strength’ in duty, and his support in trial, enabling him to
‘run in the way of His commandments’ when the Lord has thus ‘enlarged
his heart.’</p>
<p>It was by the doctrine of Justification by grace through faith, as by a
ray of light from heaven shining into their hearts, that the Reformers,
in whose souls the work of the great spiritual revival was first wrought
before it took effect on the face of Europe, obtained relief from the
bondage of legal fear, and entered into the liberty wherewith Christ
makes His people free.(<a class="reference external" href="#en.intro.01">1</a>) It was by the fearless
proclamation of the same doctrine that they were enabled to impart
immediate peace and comfort to many anxious inquirers, even in the cells
and cloisters of the Church of Rome, who were prepared for its reception
by those convictions of sin which the Law of God had power to awaken,
but which all the Ritualism of Popery could not appease. And it was
mainly to the influence of this one truth, carried home to the
conscience ‘in demonstration of the Spirit and with power,’ that they
ascribed their success, under God, in sweeping away the whole host of
scholastic errors and superstitious practices, by which, in the course
of many preceding centuries, men had corrupted the simpler faith and
worship of the primitive Church. ‘At the beginning of our preaching,’
says Luther, ‘the doctrine of Faith had a most happy course, and down
fell the Pope’s pardons, purgatory, vows, masses, and such like
abominations, which drew with them the ruin of all Popery….. And if all
had continued, as they began, to teach and diligently urge the article
of Justification—that is to say, that we are justified neither by the
righteousness of the Law, nor by our own righteousness, but only by
faith in Jesus Christ,—doubtless this one article, by little and little,
had overthrown the whole Papacy.’(<a class="reference external" href="#en.intro.02">2</a>)</p>
<p>If the doctrine of Justification by grace through faith be, as it
unquestionably is, the only sovereign and effectual antidote to each of
the two great tendencies of the age,—the tendency to Rationalism, on the
one hand, and the tendency to Ritualism, on the other,—the re-exposition
of it, in a form adapted to the more recent phases of these prevailing
errors, might be, at least, a new and seasonable application of the old
truth to the most urgent wants of men’s minds in the present day; and,
as such, it might be both interesting and useful, even if the doctrine
of the Reformation were universally acknowledged to be still the
doctrine of the Protestant Church. But an additional reason for a
renewed exhibition of that truth, which has heretofore been unanimously
recognised as the distinctive principle of the Reformation, may be found
in the fact, that, of late years, and within the ranks of Protestantism
itself, it has been openly assailed, as having no place either in the
formularies of the Church of England, or in the writings of the
Christian Fathers, or even in the Word of God itself. When old truths
are attacked with new weapons, they must be vindicated by new defences,
adapted to meet the most recent forms of error; and this is
pre-eminently the case, at the present day, with the cardinal doctrine
of Justification. It is not denied by its recent assailants that it was
the doctrine of the leading Reformers, or that it was unanimously
adopted and professed by all the churches which they founded, whether
Lutheran or Calvinistic, with one singular exception only—the Church of
England,—which, it seems, is neither Lutheran nor Calvinistic, and, of
course, not Protestant,—and yet not Popish,—but purely Catholic and
Apostolical! It is now alleged that the Reformed doctrine is a
‘novelty,’ which was introduced for the first time in the sixteenth
century, and which, for fifteen hundred years, had been unknown to
Catholic Antiquity, or the Church Universal; and that the Anglican
Establishment, having always adhered to a complex rule of faith,
composed of the Scriptures as interpreted by the Fathers, is unlike all
other Protestant churches in this—that she has never adopted or
sanctioned this novelty as part of her authorized creed. What renders
this ‘sign of the times’ all the more significant and ominous is the
additional fact, that all these assaults on the cardinal doctrine of the
Reformation, from whatever quarter they have proceeded, whether from
Rationalists or from Ritualists,—and they have proceeded from both,—have
invariably had one and the same aim and direction—a return, in
substance, if not in form, to the corrupt doctrine of the Church of
Rome. The views on this important subject, which are now openly avowed
in many influential quarters, are not only essentially the same with
those which were exploded, we had hoped, for ever at the Reformation,
but they are supported by the same arguments and the same
interpretations of Scripture which were then current in the Popish
Church, and which all the great divines of England—such as Davenant, and
Downhame, and Barlow, and Prideaux, and Hooker—combated and demolished,
especially in that marvellous age of sound theological learning, the
seventeenth century. Yet now Protestants have been found willing to
re-furbish the weapons of Bellarmine and Osorio, and to direct them anew
against the very stronghold of our faith.</p>
<p>Within the last thirty years, several writers of unquestionable ability
and learning, belonging at the time to the United Church of England and
Ireland, have come prominently forward as uncompromising opponents of
the Protestant, and zealous advocates or apologists for the essential
principle of the Popish, doctrine on this subject. The first in order
was a layman, but with a bishop as his coadjutor—Mr. Knox of Dublin,—at
one time private secretary to Lord Castlereagh, then Viceroy of Ireland,
and all along the friend and correspondent of Wilberforce, John Wesley,
and Hannah More, whose ‘Correspondence’ during thirty years with
Dr. Jebb, Bishop of Limerick, and also his ‘Remains,’ derive their chief
interest from the zeal with which he opposes the doctrine of a Forensic
Justification, and seeks to substitute for it that of a Moral
Justification by our own inherent righteousness; a doctrine which is
identical, in its radical and distinctive principle, with that of the
Church of Rome. A seasonable antidote to some of the errors, which were
thus sought to be revived in the Protestant Church, was supplied by
Dr. O’Brien, now Bishop of Ossory, in a work on ‘The Nature and Effects
of Faith;’ but it was directed, in the first instance, against the
doctrine of Bishop Bull, which made our justification to rest on faith
and works conjointly; and it was only in the second edition, published
with many enlargements, after an interval of more than twenty years,
that the special views of Mr. Knox were fully examined and criticised.
Another valuable work appeared by George Stanley Faber, partly prepared
on his own spontaneous motion, and partly called forth by a personal
appeal addressed to him by the Editor of the two concluding volumes of
Knox’s ‘Remains,’ that he should throw the shield of his authority over
the new views, by bringing his great learning to bear on the
establishment of the historical fact, asserted by Knox, that the
doctrine of Forensic Justification was a novelty introduced by the
Reformation, and that it had no place in the genuine remains of Catholic
Antiquity. The appeal was responded to, but in a style which must have
surprised and disappointed its too sanguine author; for Faber’s answer
is a thorough vindication of the Protestant doctrine, and the conclusion
at which he arrives, in regard alike to the schemes of Bull, Knox, and
Trent, is, that ‘not a vestige of any one of them can be discovered in
the writings of Ecclesiastical Antiquity,’—a conclusion which is
considerably stronger, as it appears to me, than is either warranted by
the facts of the case, or necessary for the vindication of Protestant
truth. His statement of the Protestant doctrine, and his proof of its
having been taught by <em>some</em> of the Fathers, are highly-satisfactory;
but his conclusion, as thus stated, is utterly untenable, and need not
be adopted by any one who does not hold that the unanimous consent of
the Fathers is necessary to verify any article of faith. Let any one
read ‘Ancient Christianity,’ by Isaac Taylor, and he can scarcely fail
to be convinced that much grievous error, affecting both the doctrine
and the worship of the Church, had crept in before the close of the
second century, and that it is to be found, mixed with many precious
truths, in the writings of the most esteemed Fathers. Indeed, the germ
of it existed even in the primitive Church. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>Dr. J. H. Newman, in his ‘Lectures on Justification,’ refers cursorily
to the treatises of O’Brien and Faber, but offers no formal reply to
them, otherwise than by expounding and attempting to establish his own
theory, which is substantially the same, in its fundamental principle,
with those of Bull, Knox, and Trent, although it is intended to be a
middle way between the Protestant and the Popish doctrines. It was ably
answered by Dr. James Bennett and others. Dr. Newman was then a minister
of the Church of England, and is now a priest of the Church of Rome.
This is of itself a significant indication of the tendency of the views
which he had promulgated in the ‘Tracts for the Times;’ and it is deeply
instructive to learn this additional fact, which is expressly stated in
his recent ‘Apology,’ that in early life, and at what he still believes
to have been the period of his conversion, he came under the influence
of ‘a definite creed,’ and ‘received impressions which have never been
effaced or obscured,’—that he learned his first lessons in ‘the school
of Calvin,’—that the writer who made the deepest impression on his mind,
and to whom, he says, ‘(humanly speaking) I almost owe my soul,’ was
Thomas Scott, the commentator,—that he admired the writings of Romaine,
and ‘hung upon the lips of Daniel Wilson;’ yet all this Evangelical, and
even Calvinistic, teaching has resulted in his renouncing the
Protestant, and preferring the Romish, doctrine of a sinner’s acceptance
in the sight of God.(<a class="reference external" href="#en.intro.03">3</a>)</p>
<p>This is only one specimen, selected from among many which might be
mentioned, of a process which has been going on extensively for years
past, in certain circles of society, and which, whether it results in
avowed Romanism, or stops short at some intermediate stage, indicates,
with sufficient clearness, an uneasy restlessness of mind, arising
partly from some sense of sin, but also from superficial views of men’s
guilt and helplessness as sinners, and partly from inadequate
apprehensions of the nature, value, and efficacy of the remedy which is
provided for them in the Gospel. Hence the necessity of expounding anew,
in these critical times, and that, too, for the benefit of Evangelical
Protestants themselves, the full meaning, and the scriptural proofs, of
the cardinal doctrine of the Gospel,—the doctrine of a full and free
Justification, by grace, through faith in Christ alone. It is true that
the writings to which I have referred, may be confined, in the first
instance, to the educated classes, and may not directly affect the great
body of the Protestant community; but, not to speak of the inevitable
influence which, in this age of general literature, minds of high
culture will ever exercise on popular opinion, it must never be
forgotten that there is a deeper and more fertile source of error on
this subject than false teaching from without,—it has an ally and an
accomplice within; for there is profound truth in the memorable saying
of Robert Trail: ‘There is not a minister that dealeth seriously with
the souls of men, but he finds an Arminian scheme of justification in
every unrenewed heart.’(<a class="reference external" href="#en.intro.04">4</a>)</p>
<p>That these Lectures may be adapted to the exigencies of the present
times, it is necessary to keep steadily in view the theories and
speculations which have recently appeared, and to suggest such
considerations as may serve to neutralize or counteract their injurious
influence. But they are designed to be didactic, rather than
controversial. For it has long been my firm conviction, that the only
effective refutation of error is the establishment of truth. Truth is
one, error is multiform; and truth, once firmly established, overthrows
all the errors that either have been, or may yet be, opposed to it. He
who exposes and expels an error, does well; but it will only return in
another form, unless the truth has been so lodged in the heart as to
shut it out for ever. The great object, therefore, should be, to expound
the doctrine of Justification in its full meaning, as it is revealed in
Scripture,—to illustrate the great principles which are involved or
implied in it,—to adduce and apply the scriptural proofs on which it
rests,—and to contrast it with such other methods of obtaining pardon
and acceptance with God as men have devised for themselves; and this,
with a view to two practical results: first, to direct some, whose
consciences have been awakened but not appeased, to a sure ground of
immediate pardon and acceptance; and secondly, to direct believers, who
are still burdened with doubts and fears, to such views of the nature,
grounds, and evidences of this great Gospel privilege, as may serve,
under the divine blessing, to raise them to a more comfortable enjoyment
of it, by adding the ‘assurance of faith’ and ‘hope’ to ‘the assurance
of understanding.’</p>
